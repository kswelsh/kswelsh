Hello, I am Kyle Welsh and I am currently at Computer Science major at North Central College.
I am currently just about to start my senior year (as of 7/29/2021) and look forward to learning more about Computer Science.

Oddly enough, I really enjoy C++, even though it can be confusing at times, but that is really what makes it more fun.

This semester I am going to be learning operating systems, android app development, linux programming, database systems,
and algorithms.

Personally I am most intrested in database management, large scale object-oriented database systems, app development,
any type of C++ programming, and linus programming.

The best way to currently reach me is through my school email, kswelsh@noctrl.edu, I would be happy
to answer any questions or collaborate on certain projects.
